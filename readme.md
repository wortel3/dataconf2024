# DataConf 2024 - LLM Examples

Welcome to the readme file for the code used in the DataConf 2024 conference! This repository contains examples of Language Model Models (LLMs) that were showcased during the conference.

## Purpose

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate the capabilities and potential applications of LLMs in the field of data analysis and processing. These examples serve as a starting point for developers and researchers interested in exploring LLMs and their use in various data-related tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies as specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Explore the different examples provided in the repository.
4. Modify and experiment with the code to suit your specific needs.

## Examples

The repository includes several examples that showcase the power of LLMs in different data-related scenarios. Each example is contained in its own directory and comes with a detailed README file explaining its purpose and usage.

Here are some of the examples included:

1. **Text Generation**: Generate realistic and coherent text based on a given prompt.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of text data and classify it as positive, negative, or neutral.
3. **Language Translation**: Translate text from one language to another using LLMs.
4. **Question Answering**: Build a question-answering system that can provide accurate answers based on a given context.

Feel free to explore these examples and adapt them to your own projects!
